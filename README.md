# password-generator

## Description
  This is a password generator that I created using Javascript. This webpage prompts the user asking how long they want the new password to be. Then asks what kind of    characters they would like to use (numbers, special, uppercase and lowercase). The password must be between 8 - 128 characters long so if the user chooses a number that  is outside of that range the page with alert the user. The user must also selection one of the confirm box options otherwise the page with alert the user as well. With   this project I learned how to use while statements, for statements and if statements. I also learned   how to use functions, event listeners, prompts, alerts and confirm boxes. I created a random generator and how to use it to randomly select values out of an array.
